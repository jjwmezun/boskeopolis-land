# Boskeopolis Land

## Â¿What Is this Game?

A simple platformer based on the short-story series, (_Boskeopolis Stories_)[https://boskeopolis-stories.com/].

You play as thief Autumn Springer in her rhymin' & stealin' ventures round Boskeopolis, collecting gems, diamonds, & accomplishing each level's goal to continue on to the next level. Most levels just require you to get the red-&-white-striped delectable "Keycane" @ the end, while others have zanier goals, like collecting a certain # o' PTS ( Boskeopoleon currency ) from gems, collecting a key & reaching a treasure chest, or surviving for a certain amount o' time. These goals are shouted @ you @ the start o' every level like a _WarioWare_ minigame.

## 'Bout the Development o' this Game

For some reason, I chose to make this game have a monochrome palette system. Each "GameState" has a palette which is used to paint all the textures by indexed color.

Important note 'bout image resources: all images must use the same 7-color indexed palette. Non-indexed graphics will throw an exception when loaded, as it tries to apply the palette to indexed colors & can't 'cause they're not there.

Level, map, palette, & tileset data is held in JSON files in the resources folder. Maps can have any filename & are linked from level files, but level files & block files must have a 3-digit # for a name & are loaded automatically. To add a level, just create a valid JSON file in the levels folder with a 3-digit # below the current limit specified in the Levels class ( now 64 ).

## How to Use

### Compilation

* SDL2 with SDL_image
* C++ 11 or higher
* RapidJSON with OStreamWrapper

As mentioned earlier, if you want to add images, you have to use a certain 7-color palette for all files. A GIMP palette file is provided in the resources folder. Just import this into GIMP & turn any image you want to use to indexed ( Image -> Mode -> Indexed ) & select "Use Custom Palette" & the imported palette. Make sure "Remove unused colors from colormap" us unchecked.

Editing or creating new map files requires a recent version o' Tiled ( must allow for mo' custom property values than just string ). Maps should be saved as uncompressed JSON files.
