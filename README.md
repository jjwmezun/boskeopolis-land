# Boskeopolis Land

A dumb li'l platformer game made with C++ & SDL2.

You play as Autumn Springer & go round levels collecting gems, diamonds, & accomplishing goals. Most levels just require you to get the striped Keycane @ the end, while others have zanier goals, like collecting a certain # o' PTS from gems or racing opponents to a goal.

For some reason, I chose to make this game have a monochrome palette system. Each "GameState" has a palette which is used to paint all the textures by indexed color.

Important note 'bout image resources: all images must use the same 7-color indexed palette. Non-indexed graphics will throw an exception when loaded, as it tries to apply the palette to indexed colors & can't 'cause they're not there.

Level, map, palette, & tileset data is held in JSON files in the resources folder. Maps can have any filename & are linked from level files, but level files & block files must have a 3-digit # for a name & are loaded automatically. To add a level, just create a valid JSON file in the levels folder with a 3-digit # below the current limit specified in the Levels class ( now 64 ).

## How to Use

### Compilation

* SDL2 with SDL_image
* C++ 11 or higher
* RapidJSON with OStreamWrapper

As mentioned earlier, if you want to add images, you have to use a certain 7-color palette for all files. A GIMP palette file is provided in the resources folder. Just import this into GIMP & turn any image you want to use to indexed ( Image -> Mode -> Indexed ) & select "Use Custom Palette" & the imported palette. Make sure "Remove unused colors from colormap" us unchecked.

Editing or creating new map files requires a recent version o' Tiled ( must allow for mo' custom property values than just string ). Maps should be saved as uncompressed JSON files.

## Dumb Things I Gotta Do Someday

### Basic Code
* Fix glitch wherein Autumn can't move upward on a ladder after a map transition.
* Sprite class still a mess -- look into organizing states ( isJumping, isDucking, onLadder, etc. ) into finite state machine ).
* Timers kinda wonky. In particular, I want to find a way to encapsulate common "if hit; else if on, update; else, start" pattern in the class itself so I don't have to keep typing it. Sometimes the stopping mechanism for TimerSimple is wonky ( see SewerMonster class ).

### Levels
* Lunacy
	* Think o' clever things to do with space physics & ways to not make it slow, sluggish, & boring.
* Sherbet Slopes
	* Figure out what I want to do with this level.
* Mt. Volcocoa
	* Design map.
	* Think o' clever things to do with heat mechanic.
* Â¡Precipitous!
	* Get round to making this, since I already made it before & it shouldn't take any effort.
* The Minus Touch
	* Finish map.
* Hoot Chutes
	* Finish map.
	* Draw owl.
* Curse o' the Ladder-Splayed Caves
	* Figure out what else to do with this level.
	* Fix level-select screen so this level name doesn't splay out into the scores (should make level names take up a'least 2 miniblocks o' vertical space & have them have a line-limit set).
* Pepperoncini Pyramid
	* Design map.
	* Think o' ideas for sprites & dangers.
* Windy Woods
	* Design map.
	* Think o' clever things to do with wind mechanic.
